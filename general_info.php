                <p>The city of Hyderabad is known for its delicious food varieties.

            <div class="col-md-12">
                  <p>A Conference Help Desk will be set up at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport Hyderabad. Please ask the volunteers at the help desk for any assistance for traveling to the hotel or venue from the airport. You can use mobile apps to get a cab from Ola or Uber. Prepaid authorized airport taxis are also available at the airport. The city of Hyderabad has good bus and train connectivity, but, for short distance travel, it is more comfortable to hire a cab. A cheaper and perhaps slightly adventurous option is the three-wheeler auto-rickshaw (colloquially known as “auto”). Always pay the fare by the meter. You can also book an auto using the Ola app.</p>
                  <p>Light motor vehicles and heavy vehicles follow the right-hand driving system. We strongly advise you against driving in Hyderabad particularly if you are not used to driving on Indian roads.</p>
