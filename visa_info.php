                <p>In addition to the documents described above, some embassies may require additional information. Please check the website of the Indian Embassy in your country under the heading ‘Conference Visa’.</p>

                <p>Accompanying Persons are not entitled to attend the Congress Technical Sessions and should apply for a Tourist Visa. </p>
                <p>The application process for Tourist Visa is much simpler than Conference Visa. No letter of invitation is required. Accompanying persons can use the e-Tourist visa facility at the website <a href="https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/tvoa.html">https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/tvoa.html</a></p>
                <p>For a Tourist Visa, the purpose of the visit should be stated as Tourism. Mentioning “Conference” on a Tourist Visa application is incorrect and will lead to the visa application being rejected.</p>
                <p>Letters of invitation are issued only to delegates attending the Scientific Congress, not to accompanying family persons.</p>
