                <ul>
                    <li>Poster should be written ONLY in the English language.</li>
                    <li>Poster Number (on the top left corner)</li>
                    <li>Title of the E-Poster (should be brief and match the submitted abstract)</li>
                    <li>Names and affiliations of all authors (each author to be marked with superscript Arabic number (such as 1, 2) with their corresponding institute affiliation and their addresses.</li>
                    <li>The logo of the affiliated institution/university should be placed in the upper left-hand corner, whilst the first author’s color photograph (passport style) should be placed in the upper right-hand corner of the poster.</li>
                    <li>Arial font should be used throughout the poster with such clarity that it could be read from 1.5 meters distance. The title and subheadings should be written in bold. Italics should be avoided as it would be harder to read from a distance.</li>
                    <li>Please be considerate when using colours for the presentation, keep only 2-3 colours as this would be a formal scientific poster presentation. Please select background colours that contrast well with the font to allow easier reading of your text. Avoid backgrounds with bright or dark colors and full of texture as this will distract readers.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that any photographs or figures being used in the poster are of sufficient size so that they are clearly visible, with a minimum 300-dpi resolution. The number of photographs should be limited to only those that are essential and relevant for the poster (preferably not exceeding 4-6 photos). Do not submit any photographs or pictures that are not relevant to the text, such as cartoon characters, etc. Photographs for case report presentation should be in standard quality for all extra-oral/intra-oral photos and pre-treatment/post-treatment photos. The radiograph’s view must be of good quality and have minimal distortion.</li>
